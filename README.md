# Hardhat Token - ERC-20 Token Implementation in Solidity

This repository showcases the development of a smart contract in Solidity, focusing on an ERC-20 compatible token. The project utilizes a local Hardhat network for development and employs the Remix IDE for contract deployment.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone or download the ZIP file of the project.
2. Extract the main folder to your local device.
3. Open the folder with VSCode and run the command `npm i` in the terminal to install the necessary dependencies.

### Execution

#### Setting up Hardhat's local network

1. After installing the required dependencies, start the local Hardhat network by running `npx hardhat node` in the terminal.
2. Configure the Hardhat network in Metamask using the provided steps [here](https://support.chainstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408642503449-Using-MetaMask-with-a-Hardhat-node).
3. Import a Metamask account with the given private keys from the Hardhat setup.

#### Compiling and Deploying the Contract

1. Copy the contents of `hardhat.sol` and paste them into Remix IDE.
2. Compile the smart contract.
3. Configure Remix to connect to the local network by selecting the "Injected Provider" option from the dropdown menu in the "Deploy & run transactions" panel.
4. Verify the connection in Metamask with the configured Hardhat Network.
5. Deploy the smart contract and test its functionalities.
